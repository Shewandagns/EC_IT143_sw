Susan H. Porter, Primary General President, taught: 
“When you know and understand how completely you are loved as a child of God, it changes everything. 
It changes the way you feel about yourself when you make mistakes. 
It changes how you feel when difficult things happen. 
It changes your view of God’s commandments. 
It changes your view of others and of your capacity to make a difference.”
